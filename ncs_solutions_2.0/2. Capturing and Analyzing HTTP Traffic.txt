Step 1: Start Wireshark
Click                                                   Start Capture

Step 2: Visit a Website
Open a web browser (Chrome/Firefox)
Visit a non-HTTPS site, e.g.:                           http://example.com

Step 3: Stop Capture
Once the website finishes loading
Go back to Wireshark and click the                      red square (stop) button

Step 4: Apply HTTP Filter :-                            http
In the display filter bar, type http and hit Enter
This filters only HTTP packets

🔍 Step 5: Analyze the Following
✅ Q1: What is the IP address of the web server?
Find the first HTTP GET request
Look at Destination IP in the Info pane (right-click > Follow > TCP Stream if needed)

✅ Q2: Identify a GET request
Click on a packet with “GET /” in the Info column
Expand Hypertext Transfer Protocol in the lower pane

✅ Q3: What is the User-Agent string used by the browser?
Still in the GET request
Expand Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Look under User-Agent: (e.g., Mozilla/5.0...)



📘 Summary: How HTTP Traffic is Structured
HTTP is a request-response protocol.
Client sends GET or POST request to server.
Server responds with status code (e.g., 200 OK) and content.
Header fields (like Host, User-Agent, etc.) describe the client/browser.
