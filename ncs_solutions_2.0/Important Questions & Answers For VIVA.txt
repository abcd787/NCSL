					🔹 Problem 1: Nmap – Network Scanning


Q1. What is Nmap used for?
👉 To scan hosts for open ports, detect services, OS info, and security weaknesses.

Q2. What does the -sV flag in Nmap do?

What is the difference between a ping scan and a port scan?
Ping scan checks if the host is up.
Port scan identifies which ports are open.

What command performs OS detection in Nmap?
nmap -O <target IP>

What are some security risks of open ports?
Unpatched services (e.g., FTP, Telnet) can be exploited for unauthorized access.

What does an aggressive scan (-A) include?
OS detection, version detection, script scanning, traceroute

nmap -p 22,80,443 <target IP>



					🔹 Problem 2: HTTP Traffic in Wireshark


Q5. How do you filter only HTTP packets in Wireshark?

Q6. What is a GET request in HTTP?
👉 A request method used by the client to request data from the server.

Q7. Where do you find the User-Agent in a Wireshark HTTP GET packet?
👉 Inside the Hypertext Transfer Protocol section → User-Agent header.

What is the structure of an HTTP request?
Method (GET/POST), URI, HTTP version, headers

How do you identify a GET request?
Look in Info column for "GET /..."

What is the significance of the User-Agent field?
Identifies the browser or client making the request

Q9. What is a DNS query and response?
👉 Query: client asks for IP of a domain. Response: DNS server returns the IP.

Q10. What happens if DNS resolution fails?
👉 The domain cannot be reached; browser shows “Server not found” error.

What does a DNS query contain?
Domain name, query type (A, AAAA, MX), ID, flags

How to filter DNS queries only?
dns.flags.response == 0

What is a typical DNS response code for success?
No error (0)

How do you know if DNS failed?
Response code: Name Error (3)

Why does DNS use UDP?
It's faster and doesn't require connection overhead




					🔹 Problem 4: TCP 3-Way Handshake in Wireshark


Q11. What are the three steps of TCP handshake?
👉 SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK

Q12. Why is a TCP handshake needed?
👉 To establish a reliable connection between client and server before data is transferred.

Q13. How to filter SYN packets only in Wireshark?
👉 Use: tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0

What TCP flag indicates a handshake start?
SYN

What is the flag combination in the second step?
SYN + ACK

What does the ACK packet do?
Confirms the connection establishment

What does a complete TCP handshake ensure?
Reliable connection between sender and receiver

How to filter SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK in Wireshark?
tcp.flags.syn == 1 for SYN, tcp.flags.ack == 1 && tcp.flags.syn == 1 for SYN-ACK




					🔹 Problem 5 & 6: Vigenère Cipher (C++)


Q14. What type of cipher is Vigenère?
👉 A polyalphabetic substitution cipher.

Q15. Vigenère decryption formula?
👉 P = (C - K + 26) % 26

Q16. How is encryption different?
👉 C = (P + K) % 26

Q17. What is the advantage of Vigenère over Caesar cipher?
👉 It uses multiple alphabets, making frequency analysis harder.

What is the formula for decryption?
P = (C - K + 26) % 26

How is the key reused?
It loops over the plaintext length

What is the expected output if ciphertext is LXFOPVEFRNHR and key is LEMON?
ATTACKATDAWN

How does decryption differ from Caesar cipher?
It uses a key with multiple shifts, not a single one

How is character conversion handled in code?
Subtract and add ASCII of 'A' to convert between char and index

What is the encryption formula?
C = (P + K) % 26

What does toupper() do in C++?
Converts a character to uppercase

How to handle wrapping in C++?
Use modulo operator % 26

What happens if plaintext is longer than the keyword?
Keyword is repeated in a loop

What input validation should be done?
Ensure only alphabetic uppercase characters
