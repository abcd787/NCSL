                                              Click Start Capture

Step 2: Visit 3 websites one by one (e.g.):
                                              www.google.com
                                              www.wikipedia.org
                                              www.github.com

Step 3: Stop the Capture
        Click the stop button (red square)

Step 4: Apply DNS Filter
                                               dns


üîç Step 5: Analyze the Following
‚úÖ Q1: What IP addresses are returned for the visited domains?
Look for Standard query response packets
Expand the Domain Name System (response) section
IP addresses will be listed under Answer Section

‚úÖ Q2: Identify a DNS Query and its Response
Find a pair:
One packet is Standard query for www.google.com
Next is Standard query response with resolved IP(s)

‚úÖ Q3: Was there any failed DNS resolution?
Look for packets with:
No such name
Response code: Name Error
This means the DNS server couldn't resolve the domain



Example Table:
Domain Name	        Resolved IP Address(es)
www.google.com	        142.250.182.100
www.wikipedia.org	208.80.154.224
www.github.com	        140.82.121.4
