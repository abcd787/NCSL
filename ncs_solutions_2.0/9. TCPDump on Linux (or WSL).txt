TASK 1: Capture All Network Traffic			sudo tcpdump -i eth0
	In your browser, visit:				http://example.com
							press (Ctrl + C) to stop.

TASK 2: Capture Only HTTP Traffic			sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
	In your browser, visit:				http://example.com
							press Ctrl + C to stop capture.

TASK 3: Capture and Analyze TCP Handshake		sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp
	In browser, visit:				https://www.google.com
							Press Ctrl + C to stop.
	Find these in the output:
							SYN → from client
							SYN, ACK → from server
							ACK → from client
	This is the TCP 3-way handshake.



ANALYSIS QUESTIONS (Answer Based on Capture)

1. What type of traffic was most common?
Look at TCP/UDP/ARP counts in the first capture.

2. What were the source and destination IPs in the handshake?
From Task 3: Find IPs in SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK packets.

3. What domain was resolved in DNS queries?
From Task 2 or 3: See if DNS packets are captured (use port 53 if needed).
