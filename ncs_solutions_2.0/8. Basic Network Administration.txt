      Replies from that IP

     What to find:

     Look for ports like :80, :443 in Local Address





I was able to view all my network settings using ipconfig. My PC had a valid IP address, gateway, and DNS. 

Pings to the gateway, Google DNS, and websites were successful with no packet loss. 

Tracert showed network hops to reach google.com, and nslookup resolved DNS correctly.

Netstat showed several established connections, including on ports 80 and 443.

This confirms that my system has a working internet connection and functional network configuration.
